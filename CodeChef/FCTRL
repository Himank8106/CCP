// The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of n is determined by the number of multiples of 5 in n!. Since multiples of 5 contribute one trailing zero, multiples of 25 contribute two trailing zeroes, multiples of 125 contribute three trailing zeroes, and so on, we divide n by 5 to count the number of multiples of 5, by 25 to count the number of multiples of 25, and so on. The process continues until n becomes 0.
